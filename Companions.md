### Lord/Vassal Companions

Lord/Vassal companions are built differently than other companions.

Their attribute allocation is as follows:

Attributes:
1. STR: 15 (Min), 18 (Good), 21 (Excellent)
2. CHA: 21

Their skill allocation is:

Skills:
1. Leadership: 6 (Min) (Requires CHA 18, 21 Ideal)
2. Pathfinder

The main purpose for having high STR is because STR is used to determine auto-calculated battles.

The main purpose for having high CHA is because CHA is used to level the Leadership skill, and Pathfinding which
increases world map movement speed.

NOTE:
- All other stats have no effect
    - Prisoner Management is useless since they can have an infinite number of prisoners
    - Trainer has no effect on troop quality, only useful for when he's in your party
