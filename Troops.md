## Troop Combat


For Troop Battles in PoP, keep in mind the following guide rules:

- Bows outscale Guns
- Mounted-Ranged units are bad. The A.I is not good and the troops aren't effective.
- Ranged units are very good. You always want to have lots of them.

## Troop Tree Discussion:




The tiers for best troops are as follows:

	Knighthood Order & Noldor > Noble > Common

The best factions for each unit type are as follows:

NOTE:
- The Sarleon Cavalry, though they are the best common-tier cavalry unit are still not very good.
